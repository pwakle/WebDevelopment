    <h2>1 Box Model Width, Height, and Margin</h2>
    
    <p>
    Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to 
    create more complex layouts with CSS
    </p>
    <P>
        The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
        It consists of: borders, padding, margins, and the actual content
    </P>

  
    
    <Div>
    The innermost component of the box model is the actual content of the element. 
    It can be text, image, video, etc. The content area is defined by the width and height properties.
    </Div>

    <div>
        What is padding? <br>
        Padding is the the space between the actual content and the border of the element
    </div>
    <div>
        The border surrounds the content and padding and gives the visual border of the element.
    </div>
    
    <div>
        The margin is the space outside the element that separates it from other elements in the layout.
    </div>

    <div>
        This text is the content of the box. We have added a 50px padding, 20px margin and a 10px green border.
    </div>

    <p>
        Some HTML elements, header & paragraph use block as their outer display type by default.
