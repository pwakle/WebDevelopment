    <h2>Learn Opacity</h2>
    <div id="old">
        Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.
    </div>
    
    <section>
        <div id="rgba">
            opacity applies to the element as a whole, including its contents, 
            even though the value is not inherited by child elements. 
        </div>

        <div>
            Thus, the element and its children all have the same opacity relative to the element's background,
            even if they have different opacities relative to one another.
        </div>

    </section>
